# AI/ML Projects

### Run the Python files
To execute the demo project files run, the following command.
```bash
python .\ml-basics\demo.py
```

### Jupyter Notebooks
**Jupyter** (formerly IPython Notebook) is an open-source project that lets you easily combine Markdown text and executable Python source code on one canvas called a notebook. 

### Setting up the environment
To work with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, you must activate an Anaconda environment in VS Code, or another Python environment in which you've installed the Jupyter package. To select an environment, use the ***Python: Select Interpreter*** command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

1. Create a virtual environment, run the following command.
```bash
python -m venv .venv_ai_ml_projects
```

2. Install Jupyter package
```bash
pip install jupyter
```
Once the appropriate environment is activated, you can create and open a Jupyter Notebook, connect to a remote Jupyter server for running code cells, and export a Jupyter Notebook as a Python file.

3. You can create a Jupyter Notebook by running the ***Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook*** command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) or by creating a new .ipynb file in your workspace.
