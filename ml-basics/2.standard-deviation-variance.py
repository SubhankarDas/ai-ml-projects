# standard deviation - describes how spread are the values from the average i.e mean
# less the standard deviation closer the values are to the mean
# more the standard deviation more spread the values from the mean

# variance = standard deviation ^ 2

# calculate variance -
# 1. calculate mean: (a + b + c)/3 = mean
# 2. calculate diff.: (a - mean) = x     (b - mean) = y     (c - mean) = z
# 3. add there squares and the average: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/3 = variance


# standard deviation = sqrt(variance)
print("standard deviation : ", math.sqrt(variance))

# std -> omega(Ïƒ)     var -> omega^2
